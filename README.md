These codes are used to study the magnetic behavior of magnetic nanoparticles and topological spins in magnetic nanoparticles.

The codes are used in our research article "Topological spin textures and topological Hall effect in centrosymmetric magnetic nanoparticles", A. Ullah et. al. Phys. Rev. B 108, 184432 (2023) (https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.108.184432?ft=1). In our article we used this code to explain our analytical results. Our analytical results and micromagnetic simulations agrees with each other.

The code is based on Ubermag softwere (Python based OOMMF) (https://ubermag.github.io/), (M. Beg, M. Lang and H. Fangohr, “Ubermag: Toward More Effective Micromagnetic Workflows,” in IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, vol. 58, no. 2, pp. 1-5, Feb. 2022, Art no. 7300205, doi: 10.1109/TMAG.2021.3078896).
